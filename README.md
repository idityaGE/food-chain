## üìã Problem Statement

**Problem Statement ID:** `25045`

**Problem Statement Title:** Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Transparency for Agricultural Produce

### Description

Create a blockchain-based system to track agricultural produce from farm to consumer, ensuring transparency in pricing, quality, and origin. The solution should allow stakeholders (farmers, distributors, retailers) to verify transactions and reduce exploitation in the supply chain.

### Expected Outcome

A decentralized platform with a user-friendly interface for farmers and consumers to trace produce, reducing fraud and ensuring fair pricing, deployable on low-cost hardware or cloud infrastructure.

### Technical Feasibility

Leverages existing blockchain frameworks like Ethereum or Hyperledger, with smart contracts for automated tracking and QR code integration for consumer access.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Bun** (for backend) - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **PNPM** (for frontend) - [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- **PostgreSQL** (v14 or higher)
- **Git**

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idityaGE/sih-project.git
cd sih-project
```

#### 2. Setup Backend

```bash

bun run db:dev

# Run database migrations
bunx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Open Prisma Studio (optional - database GUI)
bun run db:studio
```

#### 4. Setup Blockchain

```bash
# Start local Ethereum node (in a new terminal)
anvil

# Deploy smart contracts (in another terminal)
cd ../blockchain
forge build
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

#### 5. Start Backend Server

```bash
cd ../backend
bun run dev
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

#### 6. Setup Frontend
